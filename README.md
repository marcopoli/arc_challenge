# Dataset Description
The ARC dataset consists of **7,787 science exam questions** drawn from a variety of sources, including science questions provided under license by a research partner affiliated with AI2. These are text-only, English language exam questions that span several grade levels as indicated in the files. Each question has a
**multiple choice structure** (typically 4 answer options). 

The questions are sorted into a Challenge Set of 2,590 “hard” questions (those that both a retrieval and a co-occurrence method fail to answer correctly) and an Easy Set of 5,197 questions.
